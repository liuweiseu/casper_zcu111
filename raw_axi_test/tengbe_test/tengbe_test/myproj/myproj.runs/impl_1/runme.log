INFO: [Common 17-1223] The version limit for your license is '2020.10' and will expire in 10 days. A version limit expiration means that, although you may be able to continue to use the current version of tools or IP with this license, you will not be eligible for any updates or new releases.
CRITICAL WARNING: [Vivado 12-1790] Evaluation License Warning: This design contains one or more IP cores that use separately licensed features. If the design has been configured to make use of evaluation features, please note that these features will cease to function after a certain period of time. Please consult the core datasheet to determine whether the core which you have configured will be affected. Evaluation features should NOT be used in production systems.

Evaluation cores found in this design:
    IP core 'tengbaser_phy_ultrascale' (xxv_ethernet_v2_5_1) was generated with multiple features:
        IP feature 'x_eth_mac@2018.11' was enabled using a hardware_evaluation license.
        IP feature 'xxv_eth_basekr@2018.11' was enabled using a hardware_evaluation license.
        IP feature 'xxv_eth_mac_pcs@2018.11' was enabled using a hardware_evaluation license.
        IP feature 'xxv_tsn_802d1cm@2018.11' was enabled using a hardware_evaluation license.

Resolution: If a new IP Core license was added, in order for the new license to be picked up, the current netlist needs to be updated by resetting and re-generating the IP output products before bitstream generation.
